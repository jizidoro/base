We consider the Lagrangian relaxation of the constraint set requiring that each customer must be served by exactly one vehicle yielding a constrained shortest path subproblem. We present a stabilized cutting-plane algorithm within the framework of linear programming for solving the associated Lagrangian dual problem. This algorithm creates easier constrained shortest path subproblems because less negative cycles are introduced and it leads to faster multiplier convergence due to a stabilization of the dual variables. We have embedded the stabilized cutting-plane algorithm in a branch-and-bound search and introduce strong valid inequalities at the master problem level by Lagrangian relaxation. The result is a Lagrangian branch-and-cut-and-price (LBCP) algorithm for the VRPTW. Making use of this acceleration strategy at the master problem level gives a significant speed-up compared to algorithms in the literature based on traditional column generation. We have solved two test problems introduced in 2001 by Gehring and Homberger with 400 and 1000 customers respectively, which to date are the largest problems ever solved to optimality. We have implemented the LBCP algorithm using the ABACUS open-source framework for solving mixed-integer linear-programs by branch, cut, and price.},

Using the iterated local search framework, the heuristic combines tabu search with a simple perturbation mechanism to ensure a broad exploration of the search space. We also describe a parallel implementation of the heuristic to take advantage of multiple-core processors. Extensive computational results show that the proposed heuristic outperforms tabu search alone and is competitive with recent heuristics designed for each particular problem.},

	abstract = {Neighborhood search algorithms are often the most effective approaches available for solving partitioning problems, a difficult class of combinatorial optimization problems arising in many application domains including vehicle routing, telecommunications network design, parallel machine scheduling, location theory, and clustering. A critical issue in the design of a neighborhood search algorithm is the choice of the neighborhood structure, that is, the manner in which the neighborhood is defined. Currently, the two-exchange neighborhood is the most widely used neighborhood for solving partitioning problems. The paper describes the cyclic exchange neighborhood, which is a generalization of the two-exchange neighborhood in which a neighbor is obtained by performing a cyclic exchange. The cyclic exchange neighborhood has substantially more neighbors compared to the two-exchange neighborhood. This paper outlines a network optimization based methodology to search the neighborhood efficiently and presents a proof of concept by applying it to the capacitated minimum spanning tree problem, an important problem in telecommunications network design.},

The first edition of the vehicle routing book had been highly successful, and it was then felt that the evolution of the field over the past 10 years justified a significantly revamped reedition. This led Corberán and Laporte (while exploring the cellars of the Codorníu Winery during the conference excursion) to think up a proposal for a similar arc routing book that would be produced in parallel with the second edition of the vehicle routing book, with a similar structure and the same format. Again, the last major edited book on arc routing had been published more than 10 years before and the field had evolved considerably since then. Both proposals were presented to SIAM in the summer and were accepted. Today we are proud to offer to the research community two up-to-date collections of scientific contributions written by specialists in various areas of vehicle routing and arc routing. The two books are entitled ?Vehicle Routing: Problems, Methods, and Applications, Second Edition?, Paolo Toth and Daniele Vigo, editors, and ?Arc Routing: Problems, Methods, and Applications?, Ángel Corberán and Gilbert Laporte, editors, both published by SIAM.},

Unlike similar methods, we use Limited Discrepancy Search during the tree search to re-insert visits. We analyse the performance of our method on benchmark problems.

The major ideas of tabu search arepresented with examples that show their relevance to multipleapplications. Numerous illustrations and diagrams are used to clarifyprinciples that deserve emphasis, and that have not always been wellunderstood or applied. The book's goal is to provide ''hands-on' knowledge and insight alike, rather than to focus exclusively eitheron computational recipes or on abstract themes. This book is designedto be useful and accessible to researchers and practitioners inmanagement science, industrial engineering, economics, and computerscience. It can appropriately be used as a textbook in a masterscourse or in a doctoral seminar. Because of its emphasis on presentingideas through illustrations and diagrams, and on identifyingassociated practical applications, it can also be used as asupplementary text in upper division undergraduate courses. Finally, there are many more applications of tabu search than canpossibly be covered in a single book, and new ones are emerging everyday. The book's goal is to provide a grounding in the essential ideasof tabu search that will allow readers to create successfulapplications of their own. Along with the essentialideas,understanding of advanced issues is provided, enabling researchers togo beyond today's developments and create the methods of tomorrow.},

The proposed methodology for addressing the problem is based on an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic, previously developed for the static version of the problem. In the dynamic case, multiple possible scenarios for the occurrence of future requests are considered to decide about the opportunity to include a new request into the current solution. It is worth noting that the real-time decision is about the acceptance of the new request, not about its service which can only take place in some future routes (a delivery route being closed as soon as a vehicle departs from the depot). In the computational results, a comparison is provided with a myopic approach which does not consider scenarios of future requests.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study a rich vehicle routing problem incorporating various complexities found in real-life applications. The General Vehicle Routing Problem (GVRP) is a combined load acceptance and generalised vehicle routing problem. Among the real-life requirements are time window restrictions, a heterogeneous vehicle fleet with different travel times, travel costs and capacity, multi-dimensional capacity constraints, order/vehicle compatibility constraints, orders with multiple pickup, delivery and service locations, different start and end locations for vehicles, and route restrictions for vehicles. The GVRP is highly constrained and the search space is likely to contain many solutions such that it is impossible to go from one solution to another using a single neighbourhood structure. Therefore, we propose iterative improvement approaches based on the idea of changing the neighbourhood structure during the search.},

	abstract = {For the intensively studied vehicle routing problem (VRP), two real-life restrictions have received only minor attention in the VRP-literature: traffic congestion and driving hours regulations. Traffic congestion causes late arrivals at customers and long travel times resulting in large transport costs. To account for traffic congestion, time-dependent travel times should be considered when constructing vehicle routes. Next, driving hours regulations, which restrict the available driving and working times for truck drivers, must be respected. Since violations are severely fined, also driving hours regulations should be considered when constructing vehicle routes, even more in combination with congestion problems. The objective of this paper is to develop a solution method for the VRP with time windows (VRPTW), time-dependent travel times, and driving hours regulations. The major difficulty of this VRPTW extension is to optimize each vehicle?s departure times to minimize the duty time of each driver. Having compact duty times leads to cost savings. However, obtaining compact duty times is much harder when time-dependent travel times and driving hours regulations are considered. We propose a restricted dynamic programming (DP) heuristic for constructing the vehicle routes, and an efficient heuristic for optimizing the vehicle?s departure times for each (partial) vehicle route, such that the complete solution algorithm runs in polynomial time. Computational experiments demonstrate the trade-off between travel distance minimization and duty time minimization, and illustrate the cost savings of extending the depot opening hours such that traveling before the morning peak and after the evening peak becomes possible.},

	abstract = {A manual method was developed for scheduling the vehicle fleet of a contract transport undertaking. The main requirements were observance of time limits on individual calls and the ability to allocate pairs or groups of related calls to the same vehicle. These objectives were achieved by introducing an initial allocation of calls to vehicles prior to sequential routing of the calls. The allocation was based on a model relating work density (calls per unit area) to vehicle loading (calls per unit of vehicle time), and on fact-finding research on the main parameters of calling time, travelling speed and distance. This relationship was embodied in a visual scheduling aid for use by the route planners. Implementation was successful and resulted in about 15 per cent of vehicle time being made available for additional revenue-earning work without increase in fleet size. When utilized this represented an effective saving in operating costs of about 12 per cent.},

The VRPTW is a generalization of the Vehicle Routing Problem, where the service of a customer must start within a given time interval?a so-called time window. Our method is based on a Lagrangian relaxation of the constraint set requiring that each customer must be serviced. The master problem consists of finding the optimal Lagrangian multipliers and the subproblem is a Shortest Path Problem with Time Windows and Capacity Constraints. The optimal multipliers are found using a method exploiting the benefits of subgradient methods as well as a bundle method. The method has been implemented and tested on a series of well-known benchmark problems of size up to 100 customers. Our algorithm turns out to be very competitive compared to algorithms considered in the literature, and we have succeeded in solving several previously unsolved problems.},

Given the numerous - velopments observed in the eld of metaheuristics in recent years, it appeared that the time was ripe for a second edition of the Handbook. For different reasons, Fred and Gary were unable to accept Springer?s invitation to prepare this second e- tion and they suggested that we should take over the editorship responsibility of the Handbook. We are deeply honored and grateful for their trust. As stated in the rst edition, metaheuristics are ?solution methods that orch- trate an interaction between local improvement procedures and higher level stra- gies to create a process capable of escaping from local optima and performing a robust search of a solution space. ? Although this broad characterization still holds today, many new and exciting developments and extensions have been observed in the last few years. We think in particular to hybrids, which take advantage of the strengths of each of their individual metaheuristic components to better explore the solution space. Hybrids of metaheuristics with other optimization techniques, like branch-and-bound, mathematical programming or constraint programming are also increasingly popular. On the front of applications, metaheuristics are now used to nd high-quality solutions to an ever-growing number of complex, ill-de ned re- world problems, in particular combinatorial ones.},
